# Observability

Am evaluating a couple of things here ...

(1) Observability & telemetry kickstart for both Llama-Stack and OpenShift AI.

- https://github.com/rh-ai-kickstart/llama-stack-observability

Components

`otel-collector` - OpenTelemetry collector configurations for telemetry collection and processing
`tempo` - Distributed tracing backend with S3-compatible storage
`grafana` - Visualization and dashboard management with pre-built dashboards
`uwm` - User Workload Monitoring with PodMonitors for VLLM and AI workloads
`distributed-tracing-ui-plugin` - OpenShift console integration for tracing

(2) Langfuse on OpenShift
