    "# Level 2: Simple Agent with Web Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce how to build a simple agent using Llama Stack's agent framework, enhanced with a single tool: the builtin web search tool. This capability will  allow the agent to retrieve up to date external information beyond the limits of its training data. This is an important step toward developing a more capable and autonomous agent. Make sure you have setup your environment OK in [Level 1](Level1_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb)\n",
