# Open the Jupyter notebook

6. Click **rag-workbench** to open **JupyterLab**.  
   In the login dialog box, enter the same credentials you used to log into OpenShift at the start of this lab.

7. Click **Login**  
   OpenShift AI launches JupyterLab.  

With JupyterLab now running, you will now download all of the lab materials:  
8. Click the **Git** button in the toolbar on the left side of JupyterLab.
