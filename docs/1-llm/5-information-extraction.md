# Information Extraction

As part of our claim processing, we want to extract some information from the text of a claim. In the next notebook we will investigate how the LLM can be used to do this task.

From the `rhoai-roadshow-v2/lab-materials/1-llm` folder, please open the notebook called: <a href="https://github.com/odh-labs/rhoai-roadshow-v2/blob/main/docs/1-llm/notebook/5-information-extraction.ipynb" target="_blank">5-information-extraction.ipynb</a>


When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
