# Notebook-Based LLM Example
In this exercise, we will use a notebook to investigate how LLMs can be used.

From the `rhoai-roadshow-v2/lab-materials/1-llm` folder, please open the notebook called `3-nb-llm-example.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
