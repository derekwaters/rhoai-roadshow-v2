It's kinda close to, um, a gas station and a, uh, coffee shop called Brew Haven? I'm not sure if that matters, but, yeah.\n",

      "\n",
      "The weather was, um, kinda cloudy that day, but I don't think it was raining. I mean, I can't really remember. Sorry if that's important. Anyway, the road, or, well, maybe the intersection, was kinda busy, with cars going in different directions. I guess that's, you know, a detail you might need?\n",
      "\n",
      "As for damages, my car has, uh, significant damage on the driver's side. The front door is all dented, and the side mirror is, like, hanging by a thread. It's not really drivable in its current, uh, state. The Blue Crest Sedan also had some damage, but I'm not exactly sure what because, you know, everything happened so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did manage to exchange information with the other driver. Their name is Sarah Johnson, and I got their phone number (555-1234), license plate number (ABC123), and insurance information. So, yeah, I hope that's helpful.\n",

      "I'm not sure what, um, steps I should take now. Do I need to go to a specific, uh, repair shop? Should I get a quote for the repairs?
