# üíÅ Introduction

This workshop uses JupyterLab for most of the activities. In this exercise we will:
1. Connect to the workshop environment
2. Create the OpenShift AI **Project** that you will use for the entire workshop.
3. Create a **Workbench** for you to do your work
3. Get familiar with the JupyterLab environment

# Login to OpenShift AI

Your instructor will supply you with a link that you will use to login to your OpenShift AI cluster.

1. Open the OpenShift AI console using the url provided by your instructor.  
2. Use the following credentials to login to OpenShift AI:  
      **Username:** *admin*

Wait for the status to change to *Running*.  

The workbench has now been created. You will now open the workbench, which will launch **JupyterLab**, your IDE for the lab.

# Open the Jupyter notebook

1. Click **rag-workbench** to open **JupyterLab**.  
   In the login dialog box, enter the same credentials you used to log into OpenShift at the start of this lab.

2. Click **Login**  
   OpenShift AI launches JupyterLab.  

With JupyterLab now running, you will now download all of the lab materials:  
3. Click the **Git** button in the toolbar on the left side of JupyterLab.
