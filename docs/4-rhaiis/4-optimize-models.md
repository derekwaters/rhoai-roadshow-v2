# Lab 2: Optimize Models - Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

This guide walks through how to optimize open source models using vLLM's `llm-compressor` tool. You'll learn about quantization techniques, model memory requirements, and how to validate accuracy after optimization.

Please go to the notebook `2-optimize-models.ipynb` to complete this lab.

## Summary

Model optimization with LLM Compressor and vLLM provides significant advantages:

✅ **Lower operational costs** - 40-50% GPU savings \
✅ **Faster deployment** - streamlined optimization process  \
✅ **Maintained accuracy** - minimal performance degradation \
✅ **Real-time responsiveness** - improved inference speed \
✅ **Scalability** - deploy AI smarter and cheaper 

Whether you're scaling a startup or steering an enterprise, quantization lets you deploy AI more efficiently while maintaining quality and performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment with different quantization schemes** (INT8, FP8, W4A16)
2. **Test with larger models** to see more significant compression benefits
3. **Evaluate on your specific use case** benchmarks
4. **Consider structured sparsity** for additional optimizations
5. **Explore KV Cache quantization** for long-context applications
