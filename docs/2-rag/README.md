# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

In this activity, you will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using OpenShift AI. After setting up and validating your lab environment, you will begin by exploring vector databases and understanding how they retrieve relevant information from documents. Next, you will implement a simple RAG solution that demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) generate rich responses using results from vector searches. Finally, you will examine how metadata enables traceability from generated answers back to the original source documents.
