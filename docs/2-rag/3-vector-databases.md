# Vector Databases

As part of the course material for the RAG solution we are building, this module introduces vector databases—specialised systems designed to store and search dense vector representations of text. In the next notebook, we’ll explore how they enable fast and accurate retrieval of semantically similar content.

From the parasol-insurance/lab-materials/03 folder, please open the notebook called 3-vector-databases.ipynb and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
