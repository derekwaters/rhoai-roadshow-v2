# Vector Databases

As part of the course material for the RAG solution we are building, this module introduces vector databases - specialised systems designed to store and search dense vector representations of text. In the next notebook, weâ€™ll explore how they enable fast and accurate retrieval of semantically similar content.

From the rhoai-roadshow-v2/lab-materials/2-rag folder, please open the notebook called: <a href="https://github.com/odh-labs/rhoai-roadshow-v2/blob/main/docs/2-rag/notebook/3-vector-databases.ipynb" target="_blank">3-vector-databases.ipynb</a>

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
