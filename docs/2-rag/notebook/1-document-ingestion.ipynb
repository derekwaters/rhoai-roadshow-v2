In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code. To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score , which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy. The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis , providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations. This hybrid metric not only improves the evaluation of AI-generated code but also offers a real-time, interpretable scoring system that can be integrated into the software development process, benefiting developers of all experience levels.
