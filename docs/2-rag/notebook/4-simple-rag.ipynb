    "# 📄 Docling: Preparing Text for RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docling** is used to prepare documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text documents such as PDFs, HTML pages, or plain text need to be **converted into chunks** that can be embedded and stored in a vector database. Docling simplifies this process by extracting, cleaning, and chunking content into well-structured semantic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, Docling will be used to prepare documents before they are embedded and indexed in Milvus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Docling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docling** is a Python library designed for **document preparation** in GenAI pipelines. Its role is to transform unstructured content into structured, embeddable units, typically for use in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG applications**: Extracting retrievable units from long documents\n",
    "- **Semantic search pipelines**: Chunking content into searchable segments\n",
    "- **LLM input pipelines**: Creating well-scoped context windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Docling is particularly useful for converting complex documents like PDFs into consistent formats that can be embedded by LLMs.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Docling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docling** provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-format support**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, HTML\n",
    "- **Intelligent chunking**: Preserves context while segmenting content\n",
    "- **Metadata extraction**: Title, headers, sections, and more\n",
    "- **Customisable workflows**: Fine-tune chunk size, overlap, and cleaning\n",
    "- **Streamlined RAG integration**: Designed to fit directly into vector pipelines\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunking\n",
    "- Breaks large documents into smaller parts for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- Can be based on token count, sentence boundaries, or structure (e.g. headings).\n",
    "- Prevents LLMs from exceeding context window limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlap\n",
    "- Ensures context is preserved across chunks.\n",
    "- Helpful in maintaining continuity of thought or narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata\n",
    "- Docling can attach metadata (e.g. file name, page number, section header) to each chunk.\n",
    "- Useful for traceability and debugging in RAG outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical Docling Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the document**\n",
    "   - From local files or URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parse and clean**\n",
    "   - Normalise spacing, remove boilerplate, handle special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chunk**\n",
    "   - Create segments that fit within model context limits\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enrich**\n",
    "   - Add metadata such as section titles or page numbers\n",

    "  - Interactive exploration of vector neighborhoods\n",
