# RAG Application

In this module, you'll bring together all the key components of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution. Using Docling to parse and chunk documents, Milvus as the vector database, and a GenAI model to generate responses, you'll build a working RAG pipeline end-to-end.

From the parasol-insurance/lab-materials/02 folder, please open the notebook called 4-simple-rag.ipynb and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
