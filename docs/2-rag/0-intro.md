# Retrieval Augmented Generation


Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in generative AI that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with information-retrieval systems to produce accurate, context-aware responses grounded in external knowledge. 

Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on pre-trained parameters, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base at inference time and incorporates their content into the generation process. 

This approach enhances factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows the model to respond with up-to-date or domain-specific information. For businesses, RAG provides a powerful advantage: it enables the integration of proprietary data and knowledge sources into AI responses without the need to fine-tune the underlying model. This makes RAG especially valuable for enterprise applications where reliability, traceability, and alignment with internal knowledge are essential.

Originally introduced by Meta AI, RAG was designed to address the limitations of standalone LLMs, particularly their tendency to hallucinate information when responding to knowledge-intensive queries.
