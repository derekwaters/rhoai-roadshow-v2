# Retrieval Augmented Generation


Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a generative AI technique that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the precision of information retrieval systems. By dynamically retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base at inference time, RAG enables models to generate context-aware responses grounded in external, up-to-date information.

Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG supplements generation with retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations. This approach is particularly valuable in business and enterprise settings, where responses must align with proprietary data, meet compliance standards, and maintain traceability.

Originally developed by Meta AI, RAG was introduced to overcome the limitations of standalone LLMs—especially their tendency to produce confident but incorrect answers when responding to complex, knowledge-intensive queries.
