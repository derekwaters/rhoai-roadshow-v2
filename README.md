# Red Hat OpenShift AI Roadshow II
This repo contains a revised OpenShift AI Roadshow v2 - half-day customer event.

# Vision
The roadshow v2 is intended to showcase everything that differentiates Red Hat and makes us unique.
It will be relevant to the kinds of things teams are wanting to do with generative and/or predictive/classificatory (traditional) AI.

# Background
## Problem statement
The existing AI Roadshow has fallen behind the latest RHOAI functionality and is out of date in terms of the kinds of things our customers want out of an AI/ML engineering platform and what differentiates Red Hat from other vendor and hyperscaler solutions.

One of the challenges with the current format is that the Parasol solution is very comprehensive. This makes inserting new content a major activity. I.e. The current roadshow is a victim of its own success.

A successful solution would make the roadshow activities more loosely coupled and able to be quickly extended as new product capabilities features are released. 

# Target audience
The roadshow will provide value to multiple personas:
1. Platform engineers that need to provide:  
   a. The software infrastructure that data scientists and application developers need to build intelligent applications  
   b. Model as a service or GPU as a service to their internal customers.  
3. Data scientists and data engineers and domain experts that need to prepare data for training of RAG-based solutions, and validate their performance.
4. Application developers that need to:
  a. Experiment with traditional AI/ML models and LLMs and integrate them with their intelligent applications.  
  b. Build agentic systems.  
5. DevOps engineers that need to automate GenAIOps and AIMLOps and provide auditable baseline management.  
6. Security and compliance professionals that need to ensure there are effective guardrails around the use of generative AI.  

# Roadshow format
   * Self contained labs designed to showcase a defined set of RHOCPAI features and noteworthy patterns that everyone is excited about.
   * Modules not interconnected.
   * Delivery format: Based on the ML500 course.
   * Labs timeboxed to an hour max each
   * "Follow the bouncing ball" style

# Content

Will focus on developing all of the green capabilities in the [scoping doc](https://github.com/odh-labs/rhoai-roadshow/blob/main/GEN_AI_USE_CASES.md)
