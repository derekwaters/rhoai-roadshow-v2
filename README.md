# Red Hat OpenShift AI Roadshow II
This repo contains a revised OpenShift AI Roadshow v2 - half-day customer event.

# Vision
The roadshow v2 is intended to provide short-sharp use-case (pattern)-centric labs to showcase everything that differentiates Red Hat OpenSHift AI and makes it unique.  
It will be relevant to the kinds of problems that teams want to do with generative and/or predictive/classificatory (traditional) AI.

# Target audience
The roadshow will provide value to multiple personas:
1. Platform engineers that need to provide:  
   a. The software infrastructure that data scientists and application developers need to build intelligent applications  
   b. Model as a service or GPU as a service to their internal customers.  
3. Data scientists and data engineers and domain experts that need to prepare data for training of RAG-based solutions, and validate their performance.
4. Application developers that need to:
  a. Experiment with traditional AI/ML models and LLMs and integrate them with their intelligent applications.  
  b. Build agentic systems.  
5. DevOps engineers that need to automate GenAIOps and AIMLOps and provide auditable baseline management.  
6. Security and compliance professionals that need to ensure there are effective guardrails around the use of generative AI.  

# Roadshow format
   * Self contained labs designed to showcase a defined set of RHOCPAI features and noteworthy patterns that everyone is excited about.
   * Modules not interconnected.
   * Delivery format: Based on the ML500 course.
   * Labs timeboxed to an hour max each
   * "Follow the bouncing ball" style
